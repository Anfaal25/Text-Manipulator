# Text Manipulator

## Description
The Text Manipulator is a command-line Python program that empowers users to perform various operations on inputted strings. Users can choose from a range of options to manipulate and analyze strings, such as:

- Count the number of non-whitespace characters.
- Count the number of words.
- Fix capitalization in sentences.
- Shorten spaces between words.
- Quit the program.
  
The program provides a user-friendly menu that guides users through these options.

## Features
- Count Non-Whitespace Characters: Calculate and display the number of characters in the inputted string excluding whitespaces.

- Count Words: Calculate and display the number of words in the inputted string.

- Fix Capitalization: Capitalize the first letter of each sentence in the inputted string and provide the corrected text.

- Shorten Spaces: Remove extra spaces between words in the inputted string and display the cleaned text.

- Quit: Exit the program gracefully.

## Usage
1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/Text-Manipulator.git

  
2.Navigate to the repository directory:
- cd Text-Manipulator


3.Run the program:
- python Text-Manipulator.py


4.Enter a sample text when prompted.
Choose an option from the menu by typing the corresponding letter and press Enter.
Depending on the chosen option, the program will display the relevant output or perform the specified manipulation on the inputted text.

## Conclusion
The Text Manipulator project showcases my Python programming proficiency in creating a terminal-based application for string manipulation and analysis. By offering a range of options, users can interact with the program to count characters, words, fix capitalization, and clean up spaces within inputted strings. This project demonstrates my ability to design user-friendly interfaces, manipulate strings effectively, and create functional command-line tools using Python.
